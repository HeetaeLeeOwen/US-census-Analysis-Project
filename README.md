# US-census-Analysis-Project
Analysis done on Tableau on the various factors such as employment rates, transportation, poverty rates, and income rates across the US.
Links & Summary:
https://public.tableau.com/profile/heetae.lee#!/vizhome/DistributionofEmployment/EmploymentStatus
This dashboard was aimed to compare the employment and unemployment rates of each State. The additional factor used was race and I tried to figure out if race had any effect on employment and unemployment rates.
Through the data visualization, I have sort of figured out that the employment rates were generally higher and unemployment rates lower for states that were less white race dominant. Though not easily observed, the more diverse the state was in terms of race, the higher the employment rates and lesser unemployment rates.

This dashboard was aimed to figure out which state had the best infrastructure in place for public transportation and whether the mean travel time to people’s workplaces had any impact on this regard.
Through data visualization, charting the map showing the mean travel time for each state, combined with the different methods used for transit, I concluded that travel time to work did not have an impact on good public transportation. In all the states, driving was the main source of transportation and public transportation was not the preferred form of transportation in any of the states.

This dashboard was aimed to see whether poverty and income had any correlation with each other and whether coastal states had a higher average income that non-coastal states.
Through the scatterplot, we can conclude that poverty and income had a strong negative correlation, which logically makes sense in the fact that states with lower income generally has a high poverty rate. Furthermore, the average income on coastal states were higher than the non-coastal states, meaning poverty rates generally come from non-coastal states.
Design:
Dashboard 1 – Employment Status in Correlation to Race
Chose a map graph to because I was comparing the number of employed across all the states, so a map visualization seemed like the perfect fit. Chose side-by-side bar graphs for race distribution due to having four variables for each state and bars would clearly show the difference between the amount of those four variables. A bubble chart for unemployment rate to quickly see the spread of unemployment rate through the sizes of the bubbles.
Dashboard 2 – Time spent on different Transit Methods
A map graph would be best since I was comparing just one variable among all the states. Side-by-side bar graphs for Methods of Transportation due to having five variables to compare for each individual state.
Dashboard 3 – Comparison of Poverty and Income between Coastal and Non-Coastal States
A map graph would clearly show the difference in average Income, one variable for the custom group I created comparing coastal states to non-coastal states. A scatter plot for Poverty vs Income because there are two variables to which I wanted to find their correlation to one another for the purpose of the question I wanted to answer.
